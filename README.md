# Random Roses are red, violets are blue jokes.

This is a python-driven application that runs on Flask web framework. It is fairly simple and it's purpose is to randomly generate random nonsense jokes.

# How does it work?

It fetches a local list of words (*nix only) and randomises them. 

# Unsupported environments

If you're using Windows then you'll have to manually fetch a list of words or make your own (more on https://github.com/STAT545-UBC/Discussion/issues/49)
